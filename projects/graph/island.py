# Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands. An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:
# islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
#            [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
#            [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#            [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#            [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
# island_counter(islands) # returns 4

# islands consists of - connected components
# connected - neighbors (edges)
# directions, nsew (edges)
# 2d array - graph, more or less?
# returns (shape of solution) - number of islands

# How could we write a get neighbor function that uses this shape?
# Offset coordinates

# How can find the extent of an island?
# Either of our traversals find all of the nodes of the island

# how do I explore the larger set?
# Loop through and call a traversal if we find the unvisited 1
